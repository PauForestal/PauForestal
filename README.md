## Hello foreigner! 

### If you've come this far it's because you find me interesting... at least that's what I'm looking for.

I am **Paula Vallejo**, Engineer, Python Programmer, Data Scientist and Backend Developer. I'm deeply passionate about open source resources, working directly with Linux and everything related to old school programming. 

Finally, I'm convinced that the biggest challenge is not programming but learning to read the documentation. There is the lamb's mother!

I love being constantly learning, both in programming and in life itself!
